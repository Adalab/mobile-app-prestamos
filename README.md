# App Prestamos

Mobile application and tablet for granting loans at points of sale.
This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How Ionic

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
cd app-prestamos
$ ionic serve
```

### Sass Linter

* `.scss-lint.yml` is the configuration file we use at Kubide to make sure it works in your text editor of choice (I think you use Atom) so search about it

To run the linter paste `.scss-lint.yml` in the root folder and replace `./stylesheets/` with the project's  [Sass 7-1 Architecture](https://github.com/Kubide/kubide-sass-architecture-and-styleguide/tree/master/sass-boilerplate) destination folder
